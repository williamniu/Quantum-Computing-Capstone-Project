# Notebook 02 · Konduri best classical models on our FRED-MD data

**Paper source:** Teja Konduri and Qian Li, *Forecasting Macroeconomic Variables: A Systematic Comparison of Machine Learning Methods* (July 17, 2024). PDF: <https://www.tejakonduri.com/uploads/Konduri_JMP.pdf>

**Task.** Recreate the paper's strongest practical classical model set on our processed capstone data, not just gradient/ensemble-DI models. Based on Konduri & Li's Table 1 model universe and Tables 2-8 results, this notebook runs the following eight model families:

1. **ARD(6)** benchmark
2. **Random Walk** benchmark for S&P 500 returns
3. **AdaBoost**
4. **AdaBoost-DI**
5. **kNN-DI**
6. **SVR linear-DI**
7. **Random Forest**
8. **XGBoost-DI**

**Why these eight?** Tables 2-6 show that real variables are often best forecast by AdaBoost, kNN with diffusion indices, SVR linear with diffusion indices, Random Forest, and XGBoost-DI. Tables 4-5/7-8 show that CPI and financial variables are hard for ML; the ARD or Random Walk baselines are themselves important winners. Therefore the fair capstone baseline is not only gradient boosting: it must include both econometric baselines and the recurrent top ML models from the paper.

**Important methodological note.** This notebook applies those model families to **our data substrate** from `01_data_prep.ipynb`. It is not an exact Konduri replication: our dataset is the March-2026 FRED-MD vintage, our horizons are `{1,3,6,12}`, and our shared folds are expanding 20-year train / 5-year test blocks. Every deviation is documented so the capstone write-up can be transparent.

## 2 · Preprocessing audit of the existing project substrate

This notebook intentionally **does not redo** `01_data_prep.ipynb`; it consumes the saved artifacts so model comparisons remain consistent across the capstone.

Key decisions from the previous notebook:

- FRED-MD March 2026 vintage.
- 126 raw variables; 123 retained after dropping `ACOGNO`, `ANDENOx`, and `TWEXAFEGSMTHx`.
- McCracken-Ng transformations applied to create a stationary panel.
- Shared targets: cumulative log growth for `INDPRO`, `PAYEMS`, `CPIAUCSL`, and `S&P 500` at `h = {1,3,6,12}`.
- Shared expanding folds: 20-year initial training window, 5-year test blocks, one-year step.

### Transparency flags

1. **Missing-value handling.** The previous notebook text says missing values are handled past-only, but the code also uses `bfill(limit=3)`. If this touched interior gaps, it can use future observations. I do not change the substrate here, but this should be audited before final claims.
2. **Konduri target scaling.** Konduri annualizes targets using `1200/h`. Our stored targets are unannualized cumulative log growth. Relative RMSPE is invariant to a horizon-specific scaling, but absolute RMSPE is not directly comparable to the paper.
3. **CPI definition.** Konduri treats log CPI as I(2). Our project target is CPI cumulative log growth over horizon `h`. This is a project target choice, not an exact CPI-target replication.
4. **Fold design.** Konduri uses 120-month rolling windows with monthly forecast origins. Our capstone substrate uses expanding windows with overlapping 5-year test blocks. The notebook deduplicates overlapping test predictions before headline metrics.
5. **Horizon leakage.** For target `y_{t+h}`, training labels in the last `h` months of a training fold would not be observed at the forecast origin. This notebook purges those rows before fitting supervised models.

## 3 · Assumptions, decisions, and limitations

This section is intentionally explicit. A grader should be able to tell exactly what is assumed, what comes from Konduri & Li, what comes from our previous preprocessing notebook, and what is a pragmatic capstone choice.

### 3.1 Data assumptions

| Area | Assumption / decision | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Raw source | We use the March 2026 FRED-MD vintage at `data/2026-03-MD.csv`. | Konduri uses a revised FRED-MD-style panel through 2023 with added ISM/YCharts PMI series. Our exact input data are not identical. |
| Frequency | All observations are monthly and indexed by month start. | Forecast origins, horizons, and folds are monthly. |
| Available predictors | We use the 123 retained series from `stationary_panel.parquet`. | Konduri reports 134 monthly macro/financial series after augmenting FRED-MD. We do not have the proprietary ISM/YCharts additions in this notebook. |
| Dropped series | `ACOGNO`, `ANDENOx`, and `TWEXAFEGSMTHx` were dropped in preprocessing because of high missingness or late starts. | This avoids truncating the sample, but means our predictor set differs from the paper. |
| Stationarity | We trust the McCracken-Ng transformation codes applied in `01_data_prep.ipynb`. | Most macro ML comparisons assume stationary features; three retained series still failed ADF in metadata: `HOUSTMW`, `HOUSTNE`, `PERMITMW`. |
| Missing values | We consume the preprocessed substrate as saved. We do not do additional imputation here. | The prior notebook used forward fill and also `bfill(limit=3)`. Backfill can leak future values if it hits interior gaps; this must be audited before final claims. |
| Data revisions | We use latest-vintage data, not real-time vintages. | This is standard in many academic forecasting horse races but is not a true real-time forecasting exercise. |
| Publication lags | We do not model release/calendar delays beyond the prior notebook's simple tail fill. | Some variables would not actually be known at the month-end forecast origin in production. |

### 3.2 Target assumptions

| Area | Assumption / decision | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Regression targets | We forecast `INDPRO`, `PAYEMS`, `CPIAUCSL`, and `S&P 500`. | These match the capstone sponsor targets and the key variables in Konduri Tables 2-5. |
| Horizon set | We evaluate `h = {1, 3, 6, 12}`. | Konduri uses `{1, 3, 6, 9, 12}`. We omit `h=9` because the existing project substrate does. |
| Target formula | We use the existing stored targets: cumulative log growth from `t` to `t+h`. | Konduri annualizes by `1200/h`; relative RMSPE is scale-invariant by horizon, but absolute RMSPEs are not directly comparable. |
| CPI target | We forecast CPI cumulative log growth as stored. | Konduri treats log CPI as I(2) and uses a transformation tied to inflation acceleration. Our CPI results should be described as capstone-target CPI forecasting, not exact Konduri CPI replication. |
| S&P 500 benchmark | Random Walk predicts zero future log return. | This follows the finance convention used in the paper for financial variables. |
| Label timing | For each fold and horizon, we purge the last `h` months of the training window. | Otherwise we would train on labels whose future outcome would not have been known at the forecast origin. |

### 3.3 Fold and evaluation assumptions

| Area | Assumption / decision | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Train/test protocol | We use the shared project folds: 20-year expanding training window, 5-year test block, 12-month step. | Konduri uses 120-month rolling windows with monthly forecast origins. This notebook is a capstone-baseline recreation, not an exact replication. |
| Overlapping tests | Because 5-year test blocks step by one year, test dates overlap across folds. We keep the latest valid forecast for each `(model, target, horizon, date)`. | Without deduplication, repeated dates would be over-weighted in RMSPE. |
| Metric | We use RMSPE = root mean squared prediction error. | This matches the paper's point-forecast metric. |
| Relative RMSPE | For `INDPRO`, `PAYEMS`, and `CPIAUCSL`, relative RMSPE is against `ARD(6)`. For `S&P 500`, it is against `Random Walk`. | This follows the paper's benchmark split between macro variables and financial variables. |
| Recession subset | Recession metrics use rows where `USREC_{t+h}=1`, i.e. the target month is a recession month. | This follows the paper's interpretation that the target observation belongs to a recession episode. Small recession sample sizes mean these results are noisy. |
| Statistical testing | We do not implement Diebold-Mariano tests in this notebook. | Konduri reports DM significance. Our current notebook ranks by RMSPE only. |

### 3.4 Feature-engineering assumptions

| Area | Assumption / decision | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Lags | All supervised models use six lags, `lag0` through `lag5`. | Konduri states that all models use six lags. `lag0` is information known at forecast origin `t`. |
| Full-panel features | `AdaBoost` and `Random Forest` use six lags of the full 123-variable stationary panel. | This gives them access to the same high-dimensional macro information as the DI models, without PCA. |
| Diffusion indices | DI models use PCA factors explaining 80% of training-fold variance. | Konduri chooses factor counts using Bai-Ng panel criteria and selects the smallest recommended number; our 80% rule is a transparent approximation using the existing project design. |
| PCA leakage control | StandardScaler and PCA are fit only on each fold's training months, then applied to test months. | Prevents test-window information from influencing factors. |
| Scaling | kNN-DI and SVR linear-DI include StandardScaler after PCA-lag construction; tree models do not require scaling. | Distance/kernel methods are scale-sensitive. Tree methods are much less scale-sensitive. |

### 3.5 Model and hyperparameter assumptions

Hyperparameters are intentionally simple and fixed rather than tuned on test data.

| Model | Implementation | Main assumptions |
|---|---|---|
| `ARD(6)` | `LinearRegression` on six lags of the target's stationary series | No regularization; direct h-step forecast. |
| `Random Walk` | zero predicted log return for S&P 500 | Appropriate only for return-style financial target. |
| `AdaBoost` | `AdaBoostRegressor` with shallow decision-tree base learner | Fixed `n_estimators=50`, `learning_rate=0.05`, `max_depth=3`. |
| `Random Forest` | `RandomForestRegressor` | Fixed `n_estimators=40`, `min_samples_leaf=3`, `max_features='sqrt'`. |
| `AdaBoost-DI` | same AdaBoost on PCA-lag features | PCA factors refit per fold. |
| `kNN-DI` | `KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=10, weights='distance')` | Konduri discusses `k=10` for 120-month windows; we keep `k=10` for comparability. |
| `SVR linear-DI` | linear `SVR` in a scaled pipeline, target also scaled | Fixed `C=1.0`, `epsilon=0.05`; not tuned. |
| `XGBoost-DI` | `XGBRegressor` | Fixed conservative tree boosting parameters; no test-set tuning. |

### 3.6 Scope limitations

- This notebook is for **transparent benchmark construction**, not final causal/economic interpretation.
- We do not use real-time data vintages, publication lag calendars, or nested hyperparameter tuning.
- We do not yet compare against quantum models; this notebook creates the classical benchmark they must beat.
- The current result tables should be described as: **Konduri-inspired best-model set, run on our processed capstone dataset and folds**.

### Models and feature sets

| Model in notebook | Paper source | Feature set here | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ARD(6)` | Table 1 baseline; Tables 2-4/6-7 | six lags of target's stationary series | benchmark for non-financial targets |
| `Random Walk` | Table 1 baseline; Tables 5/8 | zero future log return | benchmark for `S&P 500` |
| `AdaBoost` | Table 1; strong in Tables 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 | full 123-variable stationary panel with six lags | tree boosting on raw macro features |
| `Random Forest` | Table 1; strong in Tables 3 and 6 | full 123-variable stationary panel with six lags | bagged trees on raw macro features |
| `AdaBoost-DI` | Table 1; recurring top DI model in Tables 2-8 | PCA diffusion indices with six lags | PCA fit per fold only |
| `kNN-DI` | Table 1; strong in Tables 2 and 6 | PCA diffusion indices with six lags | inverse-distance kNN, following the paper's kNN inverse variant |
| `SVR linear-DI` | Table 1; very strong for employment/recession horizons | PCA diffusion indices with six lags | scaled linear SVR |
| `XGBoost-DI` | Table 1; strong for employment/unemployment style variables | PCA diffusion indices with six lags | gradient boosted trees on PCA factors |

### Leakage controls

- Full-panel lag features use only information available at time `t`: `lag0` through `lag5`.
- PCA is fit on the training fold only, then applied to train/test months.
- The last `h` months of each training fold are purged before fitting because their `t+h` labels would not be known.
- Because shared 5-year test folds overlap, headline metrics keep the latest prediction for each `(model, target, horizon, date)`.

## 7 · Notes for the capstone write-up

1. **Paper link and table provenance.** The model list comes from Konduri & Li Table 1. The priority set is justified by Tables 2-6 for Industrial Production, Employment, and other real variables; Table 7 for CPI/nominal variables; and Table 8 for S&P 500/financial variables. Paper URL: <https://www.tejakonduri.com/uploads/Konduri_JMP.pdf>.
2. **What we implemented.** ARD(6), Random Walk, AdaBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost-DI, kNN-DI, SVR linear-DI, and XGBoost-DI.
3. **What is not exact replication.** We use our March-2026 processed data, our project target definitions, horizons `{1,3,6,12}`, and our expanding folds rather than Konduri's 120-month rolling monthly POOS and horizons `{1,3,6,9,12}`.
4. **Leakage controls.** PCA is refit inside each fold; training rows whose `t+h` label would not yet be known are purged; overlapping test-window predictions are deduplicated before headline metrics.
5. **Preprocessing caveat.** The prior notebook's `bfill(limit=3)` should be audited. If it affects interior gaps, it introduces future information into the feature substrate.
6. **Next step for closer replication.** Add a second evaluation mode with Konduri-style 120-month rolling windows and annualized target transformations, then compare whether model rankings are stable.
